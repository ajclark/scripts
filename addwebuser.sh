# Title: Add web user

# Comment:
# 	This script will automate the process of adding a virtual host
#	to Apache and ProFTPD. SSH access is disallowed. THIS SCRIPT SHOULD NOT BE USED BY ANYONE - EVER! 
#
# Apache:
# 	An Apache VirtualHost is created for the site, and the public_html and cgi-bin directories are
# 	copied from /etc/skel. The user is setup with a 'nologin' shell to prevent SSH access.
#
# ProFTPD:
# 	Your ProFTPD configuration should contain the DefaultRoot ~ and RequireValidShell Off directives.
# 	This will allow the user to access FTP via 'nologin' - but not SSH. 
# 	In general just use SSH keys with passphrases!
